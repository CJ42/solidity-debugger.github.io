# What is the Solidity Debugger List?
A curated list of all the Errors and Warning from the Solidity Compiler.

This repository aims to help Smart Contracts Developers on Ethereum to debug their Solidity files. It offers a list of all the errors and warnings you can possibly encounter when developing with the Remix IDE or during compilation with `solc`.

The list is based on the official C++ source code from the Solidity compiler. The errors and warning messages are all mentioned in the files located in the folder [`libsolidity/analysis`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/libsolidity/analysis). 

All the errors and warnings listed below are referenced to the original source file + line number for better analysis. Some explanations and solutions are provided to help debugging.
